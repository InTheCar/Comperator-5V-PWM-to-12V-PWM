# Comperator-5V-PWM-to-12V-PWM

!!! It's under construction !!!

The target is to convert a 5V PWM Signal to 12V PWM signal


#Reference Voltage Calculation

The reference voltage should be the half of 5V.
The supplied Voltage is 12V.
The used resistors have 0.6W
We use 2 resistors for the voltage devider.

![the circuit](https://github.com/InTheCar/Comperator-5V-PWM-to-12V-PWM/blob/main/pictures/Reference%20Voltage.png)

What's the maximum current for 0.6W resistors?
